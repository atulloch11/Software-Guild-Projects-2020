Alcopedia: The Encyclopedia of Alcohol

This was my Capstone project for The Software Guild Java Certificate. It utilizes Java with Spring Boot & Spring Security, MySQL, JPA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, and Thymeleaf. API Calls to GoogleMaps, OpenBrewery DB, and Cocktail DB. Allows users to manage their favorite beers, find their favorite cocktails, and locate breweries in a specific city.
